# `tests/lexer/README.md`

## Purpose

Placeholder document for future sydraQL lexer test fixtures.

The intent is to add “golden token streams” alongside lexer work so that:

- new lexer changes can be validated against a stable set of expected token sequences
- regressions in whitespace/keyword handling can be caught early

## Current state

No fixture files exist yet; the directory contains only this README.
