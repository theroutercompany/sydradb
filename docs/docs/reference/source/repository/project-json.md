# `project.json`

## Purpose

`project.json` is a large, generated context artifact describing:

- early design goals and a high-level architecture sketch
- a roadmap-like breakdown of phases and intended features
- snippets of earlier scaffold content and example API shapes

## How to use it

Treat it as historical context rather than a normative spec:

- The source of truth for implementation is the `src/` tree.
- The source of truth for user-facing behavior is this documentation site under `docs/`.
