# `SECURITY.md`

## Purpose

Defines a security policy: supported versions and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Current state

This file currently contains the default GitHub template text and should be updated as SydraDB’s release process stabilizes.

At minimum, projects typically document:

- Which branches/tags receive security fixes
- A private reporting channel (email or a security advisory workflow)
- Expected response windows (acknowledgement, triage, fix timeline)
